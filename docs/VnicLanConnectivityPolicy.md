# VnicLanConnectivityPolicy
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "vnic.LanConnectivityPolicy"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "vnic.LanConnectivityPolicy"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Description** | **String** | Description of the policy. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | Name of the concrete policy. | [optional] 
**IqnAllocationType** | **String** | Allocation Type of iSCSI Qualified Name - Static/Dynamic/None. * &#x60;None&#x60; - Type defines that property is not applicable for an interface. * &#x60;Auto&#x60; - The system selects an interface automatically - DHCP. * &#x60;Static&#x60; - Type represents that static information or properties are associated to an interface. * &#x60;Pool&#x60; - Type defines that property value will be fetched from an associated pool. | [optional] [default to "None"]
**PlacementMode** | **String** | The mode used for placement of vNICs on network adapters. It can either be Auto or Custom. * &#x60;custom&#x60; - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is manually chosen by the user. * &#x60;auto&#x60; - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is automatically determined by the system. | [optional] [default to "custom"]
**StaticIqnName** | **String** | User provided static iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) for use as initiator identifiers by iSCSI vNICs in a Fabric Interconnect domain. | [optional] 
**TargetPlatform** | **String** | The platform for which the server profile is applicable. It can either be a server that is operating in standalone mode or which is attached to a Fabric Interconnect managed by Intersight. * &#x60;Standalone&#x60; - Servers which are operating in standalone mode i.e. not connected to a Fabric Interconnected. * &#x60;FIAttached&#x60; - Servers which are connected to a Fabric Interconnect that is managed by Intersight. | [optional] [default to "Standalone"]
**EthIfs** | [**VnicEthIfRelationship[]**](VnicEthIfRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to vnicEthIf resources. | [optional] 
**IqnPool** | [**IqnpoolPoolRelationship**](IqnpoolPoolRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Organization** | [**OrganizationOrganizationRelationship**](OrganizationOrganizationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Profiles** | [**PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship[]**](PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. | [optional]
