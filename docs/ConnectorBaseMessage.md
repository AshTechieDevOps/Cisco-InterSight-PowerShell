# ConnectorBaseMessage
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**EncryptedAesKey** | **String** | The secure properties that have large text content as value can be encrypted using AES key. In these cases, the AES key needs to be encrypted using the device connector public key and passed as the value for this property. The secure properties that are encrypted using the AES key are mapped against the property name with prefix &#39;AES&#39; in SecureProperties dictionary. | [optional] 
**EncryptionKey** | **String** | The public key that was used to encrypt the values present in SecureProperties dictionary. If the given public key is not same as device connector&#39;s public key, an error reponse with appropriate error message is thrown back. | [optional] 
**SecureProperties** | [**AnyType**](.md) | A dictionary of encrypted secure values mapped against the secure property name. The values that are encrypted using AES key must be mapped against the secure property name with a &#39;AES&#39; prefix Device connector expects the message body to be a golang template and the template can use the secure property names as placeholders. | [optional] 

## Examples

- Prepare the resource
```powershell
$ConnectorBaseMessage = Initialize-IntersightConnectorBaseMessage  -ClassId null `
 -ObjectType null `
 -EncryptedAesKey null `
 -EncryptionKey null `
 -SecureProperties null
```

- Convert the resource to JSON
```powershell
$ConnectorBaseMessage | ConvertTo-JSON
```
