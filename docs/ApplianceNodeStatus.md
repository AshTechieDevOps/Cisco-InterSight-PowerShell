# ApplianceNodeStatus
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "appliance.NodeStatus"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "appliance.NodeStatus"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CpuUsage** | **Double** | Percentage of CPU currently in use. | [optional] [readonly] 
**MemUsage** | **Double** | Percentage of memory currently in use. | [optional] [readonly] 
**NodeId** | **Int64** | System assigned unique ID of the Intersight Appliance node. The system incrementally assigns identifiers to each node in the Intersight Appliance cluster starting with a value of 1. | [optional] [readonly] 
**NodeState** | **String** | State of the node in terms of its readiness to host Kubernetes pods. * &#x60;Down&#x60; - The node is yet to come up and join as a member of theKubernetes cluster. * &#x60;Preparing&#x60; - The node has come up and joined the Kubernetes cluster,preparing to host Kubernetes pods. * &#x60;Ready&#x60; - The node is ready to host Kubernetes pods. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "Down"]
**OperationalStatus** | **String** | Operational status of the Intersight Appliance node. Operational status is based on the result of the status checks. If result of any check is Critical, then its value is Impaired. Otherwise, if result of any check is Warning, then its value is AttentionNeeded. If all checks are OK, then its value is Operational. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - Operational status of the Intersight Appliance entity is Unknown. * &#x60;Operational&#x60; - Operational status of the Intersight Appliance entity is Operational. * &#x60;Impaired&#x60; - Operational status of the Intersight Appliance entity is Impaired. * &#x60;AttentionNeeded&#x60; - Operational status of the Intersight Appliance entity is AttentionNeeded. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "Unknown"]
**StatusChecks** | [**ApplianceStatusCheck[]**](ApplianceStatusCheck.md) |  | [optional] 
**FileSystemStatuses** | [**ApplianceFileSystemStatusRelationship[]**](ApplianceFileSystemStatusRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to applianceFileSystemStatus resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**NodeInfo** | [**ApplianceNodeInfoRelationship**](ApplianceNodeInfoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**SystemStatus** | [**ApplianceSystemStatusRelationship**](ApplianceSystemStatusRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
