------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified type of this managed object, i.e. the class name. This property is optional. The ObjectType is implied from the URL path. If specified, the value of objectType must match the class name specified in the URL path. | [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | a map of display names for a resource. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Name** | **String** | The name of the domain-group. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Partition1** | **Int64** | The partition number domain group related messages are produced for &#39;Partition1&#39; category service topics. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Partition2** | **Int64** | In a cloud environment this parameter will indicate to which partition number domain group related messages are produced for &#39;Partition2&#39; category service topics. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Partition3** | **Int64** | In a cloud environment this parameter will indicate to which partition number domain group related messages are produced for &#39;Partition3&#39; category service topics. | [optional] [readonly] 
**PartitionKey** | **String** | Partition key used for producing messages to Kafka partitions. By default Domain-group id will be used as parition key. For Domain-groups belonging to Early adopters domain-group id will be prefixed with &#39;H&#39; and used as partition key, such partition key will be treated differently and messages will always be produced to partition 0. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Usage** | **Int64** | The number of devices in the domain-group. Device registration notifications are processed to update the usage of the domain-group. The on-boarding account will have multiple domain-groups, and during the device registration least used domain-group will be selected for the device. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Account** | [**IamAccountRelationship**](IamAccountRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
