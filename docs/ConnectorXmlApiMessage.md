# ConnectorXmlApiMessage
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "connector.XmlApiMessage"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "connector.XmlApiMessage"]
**EncryptedAesKey** | **String** | The secure properties that have large text content as value can be encrypted using AES key. In these cases, the AES key needs to be encrypted using the device connector public key and passed as the value for this property. The secure properties that are encrypted using the AES key are mapped against the property name with prefix &#39;AES&#39; in SecureProperties dictionary. | [optional] 
**EncryptionKey** | **String** | The public key that was used to encrypt the values present in SecureProperties dictionary. If the given public key is not same as device connector&#39;s public key, an error reponse with appropriate error message is thrown back. | [optional] 
**SecureProperties** | [**AnyType**](.md) | A dictionary of encrypted secure values mapped against the secure property name. The values that are encrypted using AES key must be mapped against the secure property name with a &#39;AES&#39; prefix Device connector expects the message body to be a golang template and the template can use the secure property names as placeholders. | [optional] 
**RemoteUserLocale** | **String** | The platform locale to assign user. A locale defines one or more organizations (domains) the user is allowed access, and access is limited to the organizations specified in the locale. | [optional] 
**RemoteUserName** | **String** | The user name passed to the platform for use in platform audit logs. | [optional] 
**RemoteUserRoles** | **String** | The list of roles to pass to the platform to validate the action against. | [optional] 
**RemoteUserSessionId** | **String** | The session Id passed to the platform for use in platforms auditing. | [optional] 
**WithAuth** | **Boolean** | Flag to disable authentication bypassing. If set to true it is expected a valid cookie/login is provided within the XML API request body. | [optional] 
**XmlRequest** | **String** | The XML request body to proxy to the platform. | [optional] 

## Examples

- Prepare the resource
```powershell
$ConnectorXmlApiMessage = Initialize-IntersightConnectorXmlApiMessage  -ClassId null `

```

- Convert the resource to JSON
```powershell
$ConnectorXmlApiMessage | ConvertTo-JSON
```
