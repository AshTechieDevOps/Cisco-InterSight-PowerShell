# ApplianceBackupPolicy
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "appliance.BackupPolicy"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "appliance.BackupPolicy"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Filename** | **String** | Backup filename to backup or restore. | [optional] 
**Protocol** | **String** | Communication protocol used by the file server (e.g. scp or sftp). * &#x60;scp&#x60; - Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) to access the file server. * &#x60;sftp&#x60; - SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to access file server. | [optional] [default to "scp"]
**RemoteHost** | **String** | Hostname of the remote file server. | [optional] 
**RemotePath** | **String** | File server directory to copy the file. | [optional] 
**RemotePort** | **Int64** | Remote TCP port on the file server (e.g. 22 for scp). | [optional] 
**Username** | **String** | Username to authenticate the fileserver. | [optional] 
**BackupTime** | **System.DateTime** | The next backup time set by the backup scheduler. Backup scheduler calculates the next backup time with the user-defined schedule set in the Schedule field. | [optional] [readonly] 
**IsPasswordSet** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the value of the &#39;password&#39; property has been set. | [optional] [readonly] [default to $false]
**ManualBackup** | **Boolean** | Backup mode of the appliance. Automatic backups of the appliance are not initiated if this property is set to &#39;true&#39; and the backup schedule field is ignored. | [optional] 
**Password** | **String** | Password to authenticate the file server. | [optional] 
**Schedule** | [**OnpremSchedule**](OnpremSchedule.md) |  | [optional] 
**Account** | [**IamAccountRelationship**](IamAccountRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
