# IamApiKey
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "iam.ApiKey"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "iam.ApiKey"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**HashAlgorithm** | **String** | The cryptographic hash algorithm to calculate the message digest. * &#x60;SHA256&#x60; - The SHA-256 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4. * &#x60;SHA384&#x60; - The SHA-384 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4. * &#x60;SHA512&#x60; - The SHA-512 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4. * &#x60;SHA512_224&#x60; - The SHA-512/224 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4. * &#x60;SHA512_256&#x60; - The SHA-512/256 cryptographic hash, as defined by NIST in FIPS 180-4. | [optional] [default to "SHA256"]
**KeySpec** | [**PkixKeyGenerationSpec**](PkixKeyGenerationSpec.md) |  | [optional] 
**PrivateKey** | **String** | Holds the private key for the API key. | [optional] 
**Purpose** | **String** | The purpose of the API Key. | [optional] 
**SigningAlgorithm** | **String** | The signing algorithm used by the client to authenticate API requests to Intersight. The signing algorithm must be compatible with the key generation specification. * &#x60;RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5&#x60; - RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 is a RSA signature scheme specified in [RFC 8017](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017).RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 is included only for compatibility with existing applications. * &#x60;RSASSA-PSS&#x60; - RSASSA-PSS is a RSA signature scheme specified in [RFC 8017](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8017).It combines the RSASP1 and RSAVP1 primitives with the EMSA-PSS encoding method.In the interest of increased robustness, RSASSA-PSS is required in new applications. * &#x60;Ed25519&#x60; - The Ed25519 signature algorithm, as specified in [RFC 8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032).Ed25519 is a public-key signature system with several attractive features, includingfast single-signature verification, very fast signing, fast key generation and high security level. * &#x60;Ecdsa&#x60; - The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Standard (ECDSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 186-4 and ANSI X9.62.The signature is encoded as a ASN.1 DER SEQUENCE with two INTEGERs (r and s), as defined in RFC3279.When using ECDSA signatures, configure the client to use the same signature encoding as specified on the server side. * &#x60;EcdsaP1363Format&#x60; - The Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Standard (ECDSA), as defined by NIST in FIPS 186-4 and ANSI X9.62.The signature is the raw concatenation of r and s, as defined in the ISO/IEC 7816-8 IEEE P.1363 standard.In that format, r and s are represented as unsigned, big endian numbers.Extra padding bytes (of value 0x00) is applied so that both r and s encodings have the same size.When using ECDSA signatures, configure the client to use the same signature encoding as specified on the server side. | [optional] [default to "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5"]
**Permission** | [**IamPermissionRelationship**](IamPermissionRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**User** | [**IamUserRelationship**](IamUserRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
