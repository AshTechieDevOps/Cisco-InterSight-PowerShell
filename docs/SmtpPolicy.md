# SmtpPolicy
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "smtp.Policy"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "smtp.Policy"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Description** | **String** | Description of the policy. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | Name of the concrete policy. | [optional] 
**Enabled** | **Boolean** | If enabled, controls the state of the SMTP client service on the managed device. | [optional] [default to $true]
**MinSeverity** | **String** | Minimum fault severity level to receive email notifications. Email notifications are sent for all faults whose severity is equal to or greater than the chosen level. * &#x60;critical&#x60; - Minimum severity to report is critical. * &#x60;condition&#x60; - Minimum severity to report is informational. * &#x60;warning&#x60; - Minimum severity to report is warning. * &#x60;minor&#x60; - Minimum severity to report is minor. * &#x60;major&#x60; - Minimum severity to report is major. | [optional] [default to "critical"]
**SenderEmail** | **String** | The email address entered here will be displayed as the from address (mail received from address) of all the SMTP mail alerts that are received. If not configured, the hostname of the server is used in the from address field. | [optional] 
**SmtpPort** | **Int64** | Port number used by the SMTP server for outgoing SMTP communication. | [optional] [default to 25]
**SmtpRecipients** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SmtpServer** | **String** | IP address or hostname of the SMTP server. The SMTP server is used by the managed device to send email notifications. | [optional] 
**Organization** | [**OrganizationOrganizationRelationship**](OrganizationOrganizationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Profiles** | [**PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship[]**](PolicyAbstractConfigProfileRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. | [optional]
