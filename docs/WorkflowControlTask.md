## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. |

**Label** | **String** | A user defined label identifier of the workflow task used for UI display. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | The name of the task within the workflow and it must be unique among all WorkflowTasks within a workflow definition. This name serves as the internal unique identifier for the task and is used to pick input and output parameters to feed into other tasks. | [optional]
