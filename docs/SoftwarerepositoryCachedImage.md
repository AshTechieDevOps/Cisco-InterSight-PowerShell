# SoftwarerepositoryCachedImage
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "softwarerepository.CachedImage"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "softwarerepository.CachedImage"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Checksum** | [**ConnectorFileChecksum**](ConnectorFileChecksum.md) |  | [optional] 
**DownloadError** | **String** | Any error encountered. Set to empty when download is in progress or completed. | [optional] 
**DownloadProgress** | **Int64** | The download progress of the file represented as a percentage between 0% and 100%. If progress reporting is not possible a value of -1 is sent. | [optional]

**Sha256checksum** | [**SystemByte**](SystemByte.md) | The sha256checksum of the downloaded file as calculated by the download plugin after successfully downloading a file. | [optional]

If &#39;Evict&#39; is set, the cached file will be removed. Applicable in Intersight appliance deployment. If &#39;Cancel&#39; is set, the ImportState is marked as &#39;Failed&#39;. Applicable for local machine source. * &#x60;None&#x60; - No action should be taken on the imported file. * &#x60;GeneratePreSignedUploadUrl&#x60; - Generate pre signed URL of file for importing into the repository. * &#x60;GeneratePreSignedDownloadUrl&#x60; - Generate pre signed URL of file in the repository to download. * &#x60;CompleteImportProcess&#x60; - Mark that the import process of the file into the repository is complete. * &#x60;MarkImportFailed&#x60; - Mark to indicate that the import process of the file into the repository failed. * &#x60;PreCache&#x60; - Cache the file into the Intersight Appliance. * &#x60;Cancel&#x60; - The cancel import process for the file into the repository. * &#x60;Extract&#x60; - The action to extract the file in the external repository. * &#x60;Evict&#x60; - Evict the cached file from the Intersight Appliance. | [optional] [default to "None"]
**CacheState** | **String** | The state  of this file in the endpoint The importState is updated during the cache operation and as part of the cache monitoring process. * &#x60;ReadyForImport&#x60; - The image is ready to be imported into the repository. * &#x60;Importing&#x60; - The image is being imported into the repository. * &#x60;Imported&#x60; - The image has been extracted and imported into the repository. * &#x60;PendingExtraction&#x60; - Indicates that the image has been imported but not extracted in the repository. * &#x60;Extracting&#x60; - Indicates that the image is being extracted into the repository. * &#x60;Extracted&#x60; - Indicates that the image has been extracted into the repository. * &#x60;Failed&#x60; - The image import from an external source to the repository has failed. * &#x60;MetaOnly&#x60; - The image is present in an external repository. * &#x60;ReadyForCache&#x60; - The image is ready to be cached into the Intersight Appliance. * &#x60;Caching&#x60; - Indicates that the image is being cached into the Intersight Appliance or endpoint cache. * &#x60;Cached&#x60; - Indicates that the image has been cached into the Intersight Appliance or endpoint cache. * &#x60;CachingFailed&#x60; - Indicates that the image caching into the Intersight Appliance failed or endpoint cache. * &#x60;Corrupted&#x60; - Indicates that the image in the local repository (or endpoint cache) has been corrupted after it was cached. * &#x60;Evicted&#x60; - Indicates that the image has been evicted from the Intersight Appliance (or endpoint cache) to reclaim storage space. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "ReadyForImport"]
