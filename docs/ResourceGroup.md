# ResourceGroup
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "resource.Group"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "resource.Group"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Name** | **String** | The name of this resource group. | [optional] 
**PerTypeCombinedSelector** | [**ResourcePerTypeCombinedSelector[]**](ResourcePerTypeCombinedSelector.md) |  | [optional] 
**Qualifier** | **String** | Qualifier shall be used to specify if we want to organize resources using multiple resource group or single For an account, resource groups can be of only one of the above types. (Both the types are mutually exclusive for an account.). * &#x60;Allow-Selectors&#x60; - Resources will be added to resource groups based on ODATA filter. Multiple resource group can be created to organize resources. * &#x60;Allow-All&#x60; - All resources will become part of the Resource Group. Only one resource group can be created to organize resources. | [optional] [default to "Allow-Selectors"]
**Selectors** | [**ResourceSelector[]**](ResourceSelector.md) |  | [optional] 
**Account** | [**IamAccountRelationship**](IamAccountRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Organizations** | [**OrganizationOrganizationRelationship[]**](OrganizationOrganizationRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to organizationOrganization resources. | [optional]
