# AssetTargetRelationship
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "asset.Target"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "asset.Target"]
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Selector** | **String** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Link** | **String** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional]

**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ClaimedByUserName** | **String** | The name or email id of the user who claimed the target. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Connections** | [**AssetConnection[]**](AssetConnection.md) |  | [optional] 
**ConnectorVersion** | **String** | The Device Connector version for target types which are managed by via embedded Device Connector. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ExternalIpAddress** | **String** | ExternalIpAddress is applicable for targets which are managed via an Intersight Device Connector. The value is the IP Address of the target as seen from Intersight. It is either the IP Address of the managed target&#39;s interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP Addresss when the target is deployed in a private network. | [optional] [readonly] 
**IpAddress** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | A user provided name for the managed target. | [optional] 
**ProductId** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**ReadOnly** | **Boolean** | For targets which are managed by an embedded Intersight Device Connector, this field indicates that an administrator of the target has disabled management operations of the Device Connector and only monitoring is permitted. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Services** | [**AssetService[]**](AssetService.md) |  | [optional] 
**Status** | **String** | Status indicates if Intersight can establish a connection and authenticate with the managed target. Status does not include information about the functional health of the target. * &#x60;&#x60; - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target. * &#x60;Connected&#x60; - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities. * &#x60;NotConnected&#x60; - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target. * &#x60;ClaimInProgress&#x60; - Claim of the target is in progress.

Also indicates the failure to claim Custom Target details in Intersight. * &#x60;Claimed&#x60; - Custom Target is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target credentials are incorrect. | [optional] [readonly] [default to ""]
