# StorageBaseRaidGroupAllOf
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | [default to "storage.HitachiParityGroup"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | [default to "storage.HitachiParityGroup"]
**Level** | **String** | The RAID level associated with the group of disks. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - Default unknown RAID type. * &#x60;RAID0&#x60; - RAID0 splits (&quot;&quot;stripes&quot;&quot;) data evenly across two or more disks, without parity information. * &#x60;RAID1&#x60; - RAID1 requires a minimum of two disks to work, and provides data redundancy and failover. * &#x60;RAID4&#x60; - RAID4 stripes block level data and dedicates a disk to parity. * &#x60;RAID5&#x60; - RAID5  distributes striping and parity at a block level. * &#x60;RAID6&#x60; - RAID6 level operates like RAID5 with distributed parity and striping. * &#x60;RAID10&#x60; - RAID10 requires a minimum of four disks in the array. It stripes across disks for higher performance, and mirrors for redundancy. * &#x60;RAIDDP&#x60; - RAIDDP uses up to two spare disks to replace and reconstruct the data from up to two simultaneously failed disks within the RAID group. * &#x60;RAIDTEC&#x60; - With RAIDTEC protection, use up to three spare disks to replace and reconstruct the data from up to three simultaneously failed disks within the RAID group. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "Unknown"]
**Name** | **String** | Human readable name of the RAID group. | [optional] [readonly] 
**StorageUtilization** | [**StorageBaseCapacity**](StorageBaseCapacity.md) |  | [optional]
