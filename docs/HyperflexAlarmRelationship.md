# HyperflexAlarmRelationship
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "hyperflex.Alarm"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "hyperflex.Alarm"]
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Selector** | **String** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Link** | **String** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Acknowledged** | **Boolean** | The acknowledgement state of the alarm. It is &#39;true&#39; when the alarm is acknowledged and false otherwise. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AcknowledgedBy** | **String** | The username of the user who acknowledged the alarm. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AcknowledgedTime** | **Int64** | The time when the alarm was acknowledged, represented as a Unix timestamp. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AcknowledgedTimeAsUtc** | **String** | The time when the alarm was acknowledged in ISO 6801 format. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Description** | **String** | The description of the alarm which includes information about the fault that triggered the alarm. | [optional] [readonly] 
**EntityData** | **String** | The data pertaining to this entity. | [optional] [readonly] 
**EntityName** | **String** | The name of entity which triggered the alarm. | [optional] [readonly] 
**EntityType** | **String** | The type of entity which triggered the alarm. For example, this can be the cluster, a node, or VM running on the cluster. * &#x60;UNKNOWN&#x60; - The type of entity is not known. * &#x60;DISK&#x60; - The entity is a physical storage device. * &#x60;NODE&#x60; - The entity is a HyperFlex cluster node. * &#x60;CLUSTER&#x60; - The entity is the HyperFlex cluster itself. * &#x60;DATASTORE&#x60; - The entity is a logical datastore configured on the HyperFlex cluster. * &#x60;ZONE&#x60; - The entity is a logical or physical zone configured on the HyperFlex cluster. * &#x60;VIRTUALMACHINE&#x60; - The entity is a virtual machine running on the HyperFlex cluster. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "UNKNOWN"]
**EntityUuId** | **String** | The unique identifier of the entity which triggered the alarm. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Message** | **String** | The localized message displayed to the user which describes the alarm. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Name** | **String** | The name of the alarm. This name identifies the type of alarm that was triggered. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Status** | **String** | The severity of the alarm. * &#x60;UNKNOWN&#x60; - The alarm status is not known. * &#x60;CLEARED&#x60; - The event that triggered the alarm has been remedied and no longer requires the user&#39;s attention. * &#x60;INFO&#x60; - The alarm represents a message that does not require the user&#39;s immediate attention. * &#x60;WARNING&#x60; - The alarm represents a moderate fault. * &#x60;CRITICAL&#x60; - The alarm represents a critical fault. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "UNKNOWN"]
**TriggeredTime** | **Int64** | The time when alarm was triggered as a Unix timestamp. | [optional] [readonly] 
**TriggeredTimeAsUtc** | **String** | The time when alarm was triggered in ISO 6801 UTC format. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Uuid** | **String** | The unique identifier for this alarm instance. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Cluster** | [**HyperflexClusterRelationship**](HyperflexClusterRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
