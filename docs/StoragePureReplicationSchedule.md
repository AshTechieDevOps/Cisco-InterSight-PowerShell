# StoragePureReplicationSchedule
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "storage.PureReplicationSchedule"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "storage.PureReplicationSchedule"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Frequency** | **String** | Replication frequency. It is an interval at which replication is set to trigger. Examples:     PT2H, Snapshot is generated every 2 hours.     P30D, Snapshot is scheduled for every 30 days.     PT2H34M56.123S is 2 hours, 34 minutes, 56 seconds and 123 milliseconds. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Name** | **String** | Replication schedule name. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ReplicationTime** | **String** | Preferred time of day at which to replicate the snapshots on target array. It is applicable only if the replication frequency is set for a day or more. Format: hh:mm:ss Example: 15:00:00, Replication is set for 3:00 PM. | [optional] [readonly] 
**RetentionTime** | **String** | Duration to keep the replicated snapshots on the targets. Replicated snapshots are deleted from target array once the retention period has elapsed. Examples: P30D, Snapshots are available for 30 days. PT2H34M56.123S, 2 hours, 34 minutes, 56 seconds and 123 milliseconds. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DailyLimit** | **Int64** | Total number of snapshots per day to be available on target above and over the specified retention time. PureStorage FlashArray maintains all created snapshot until retention period. Daily limit is applied only on the snapshots once retention time is expired. In case of, daily limit is less than the number of snapshot available on source, system select snapshots evenly spaced out throughout the day. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ReplicationBlackoutIntervals** | [**StoragePureReplicationBlackout[]**](StoragePureReplicationBlackout.md) |  | [optional] 
**SnapshotExpiryTime** | **String** | Duration to keep the daily limit snapshots on target array. StorageArray deletes the snapshots permanently from the targets beyond this period. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Array** | [**StoragePureArrayRelationship**](StoragePureArrayRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**ProtectionGroup** | [**StoragePureProtectionGroupRelationship**](StoragePureProtectionGroupRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**RegisteredDevice** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
