**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly]

Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly]

**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | a map of display names for a resource. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AltModel** | **Decimal[]** |  | [optional] 
**DeviceId** | **String** | The Moid of the Intersight managed device instance for which regression model is derived. | [optional] [readonly] 
**FullCapDays** | **Int64** | The number of days remaining before the device reaches its full functional capacity. | [optional] [readonly] 
**MetricName** | **String** | The name of the metric for which regression model is generated. | [optional] [readonly] 
**MinDaysForForecast** | **Int64** | The minimum number of days the HyperFlex cluster should be up for computing forecast. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Model** | [**ForecastModel**](ForecastModel.md) |  | [optional] 
**ThresholdDays** | **Int64** | The number of days remaining before the device reaches the specified threshold for the metric as defined in definition. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ForecastDef** | [**ForecastDefinitionRelationship**](ForecastDefinitionRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**RegisteredDevice** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
