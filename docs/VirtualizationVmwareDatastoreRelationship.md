# VirtualizationVmwareDatastoreRelationship
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "virtualization.VmwareDatastore"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "virtualization.VmwareDatastore"]
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Selector** | **String** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Link** | **String** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**RegisteredDevice** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Capacity** | [**VirtualizationStorageCapacity**](VirtualizationStorageCapacity.md) |  | [optional] 
**HostCount** | **Int64** | Number of hosts attached to or supported-by this datastore. | [optional] 
**Identity** | **String** | The internally generated identity of this datastore. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the datastore object. For VMware, this is a MOR (managed object reference). | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | Name of this datastore supplied by user. It is not the identity of the datastore. The name is subject to user manipulations. | [optional] 
**Type** | **String** | A string indicating the type of the datastore (VMFS, NFS, etc). * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - The nature of the file system is unknown. * &#x60;VMFS&#x60; - It is a Virtual Machine Filesystem. * &#x60;NFS&#x60; - It is a Network File System. * &#x60;vSAN&#x60; - It is a virtual Storage Area Network file system. * &#x60;VirtualVolume&#x60; - A Virtual Volume datastore represents a storage container in a hypervisor server. | [optional] [default to "Unknown"]
**VmCount** | **Int64** | Number of virtual machines relying on (using) this datastore. | [optional] 
**Accessible** | **Boolean** | Shows if this datastore is accessible. | [optional] 
**MaintenanceMode** | **Boolean** | Indicates if the datastore is in maintenance mode. Will be set to True, when in maintenance mode. | [optional] 
**MultipleHostAccess** | **Boolean** | Indicates if this datastore is connected to multiple hosts. | [optional] 
**Status** | **String** | Datastore health status, as reported by the hypervisor platform. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - Entity status is unknown. * &#x60;Degraded&#x60; - State is degraded, and might impact normal operation of the entity. * &#x60;Critical&#x60; - Entity is in a critical state, impacting operations. * &#x60;Ok&#x60; - Entity status is in a stable state, operating normally. | [optional] [default to "Unknown"]
**ThinProvisioningSupported** | **Boolean** | Indicates if this datastore supports thin provisioning for files. | [optional] 
**UnCommitted** | **Int64** | Space uncommitted in this datastore in bytes. | [optional] 
**Url** | **String** | The URL to access this datastore (example - &#39;ds:///vmfs/volumes/562a4e8a-0eeb5372-dd61-78baf9cb9afa/&#39;). | [optional] 
**Cluster** | [**VirtualizationVmwareClusterRelationship**](VirtualizationVmwareClusterRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Datacenter** | [**VirtualizationVmwareDatacenterRelationship**](VirtualizationVmwareDatacenterRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Hosts** | [**VirtualizationVmwareHostRelationship[]**](VirtualizationVmwareHostRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to virtualizationVmwareHost resources. | [optional] [readonly]
