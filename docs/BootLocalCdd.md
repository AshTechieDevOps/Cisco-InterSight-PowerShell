## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous.

The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**Enabled** | **Boolean** | Specifies if the boot device is enabled or disabled. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | A name that helps identify a boot device. It can be any string that adheres to the following constraints. It should start and end with an alphanumeric character. It can have underscores and hyphens. It cannot be more than 30 characters. | [optional]
