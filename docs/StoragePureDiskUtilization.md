# StoragePureDiskUtilization
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**Available** | **Int64** | Total consumable storage capacity represented in bytes. System may reserve some space for internal purposes which is excluded from total capacity. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CapacityUtilization** | **Double** | Percentage of used capacity. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Free** | **Int64** | Unused space available for applications to consume, represented in bytes. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Total** | **Int64** | Total storage capacity, represented in bytes. It is set by the component manufacturer. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Used** | **Int64** | Used or consumed storage capacity, represented in bytes. | [optional] [readonly]
