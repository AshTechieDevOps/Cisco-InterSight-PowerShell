## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**HypervisorType** | **String** | Identifies the broad type of the underlying hypervisor. * &#x60;ESXi&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is a Vmware ESXi hypervisor of any version. * &#x60;HyperFlexAp&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Cisco HyperFlex Application Platform. * &#x60;Hyper-V&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Microsoft Hyper-V. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is not known. | [optional] [default to "ESXi"]
**Identity** | **String** | The internally generated identity of this cluster. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the cluster object. In case of VMware, this is a MOR (managed object reference). | [optional] [readonly] 
**MemoryCapacity** | [**VirtualizationMemoryCapacity**](VirtualizationMemoryCapacity.md) |  | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | The user-provided name for this cluster to facilitate identification. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ProcessorCapacity** | [**VirtualizationComputeCapacity**](VirtualizationComputeCapacity.md) |  | [optional] 
**Status** | **String** | Cluster health status as reported by the hypervisor platform. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - Entity status is unknown. * &#x60;Degraded&#x60; - State is degraded, and might impact normal operation of the entity. * &#x60;Critical&#x60; - Entity is in a critical state, impacting operations. * &#x60;Ok&#x60; - Entity status is in a stable state, operating normally. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "Unknown"]
**TotalCores** | **Int64** | Total number of CPU cores in this cluster. It is a cumulative number across all hosts in the cluster. | [optional] 

## Examples

- Prepare the resource
```powershell
$VirtualizationBaseClusterAllOf = Initialize-IntersightVirtualizationBaseClusterAllOf  -ClassId null `
 -ObjectType null `
 -HypervisorType null `
 -Identity null `
 -MemoryCapacity null `
 -Name null `
 -ProcessorCapacity null `
 -Status null `
 -TotalCores null
```

- Convert the resource to JSON
```powershell
$VirtualizationBaseClusterAllOf | ConvertTo-JSON
```
