# ComputeServerSetting
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "compute.ServerSetting"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "compute.ServerSetting"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DeviceMoId** | **String** | The database identifier of the registered device of an object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Dn** | **String** | The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Rn** | **String** | The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AdminLocatorLedState** | **String** | User configured state of the locator LED for the server. * &#x60;None&#x60; - No operation property for locator led. * &#x60;On&#x60; - The Locator Led is turned on. * &#x60;Off&#x60; - The Locator Led is turned off. | [optional] [default to "None"]
**AdminPowerState** | **String** | User configured power state of the server. * &#x60;Policy&#x60; - Power state is set to the default value in the policy. * &#x60;PowerOn&#x60; - Power state of the server is set to On. * &#x60;PowerOff&#x60; - Power state is the server set to Off. * &#x60;PowerCycle&#x60; - Power state the server is reset. * &#x60;HardReset&#x60; - Power state the server is hard reset. * &#x60;Shutdown&#x60; - Operating system on the server is shut down. * &#x60;Reboot&#x60; - Power state of IMC is rebooted. | [optional] [default to "Policy"]
**ConfigState** | **String** | The configured state of these settings in the target server. The value is any one of Applied, Applying, Failed. Applied - This state denotes that the settings are applied successfully in the target server. Applying - This state denotes that the settings are being applied in the target server. Failed - This state denotes that the settings could not be applied in the target server. * &#x60;Applied&#x60; - User configured settings are in applied state. * &#x60;Applying&#x60; - User settings are being applied on the target server. * &#x60;Failed&#x60; - User configured settings could not be applied. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "Applied"]
**OneTimeBootDevice** | **String** | The name of the device chosen by user for configuring One-Time Boot device. | [optional] 
**PersistentMemoryOperation** | [**ComputePersistentMemoryOperation**](ComputePersistentMemoryOperation.md) |  | [optional] 
**ServerConfig** | [**ComputeServerConfig**](ComputeServerConfig.md) |  | [optional] 
**LocatorLed** | [**EquipmentLocatorLedRelationship**](EquipmentLocatorLedRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**RegisteredDevice** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**RunningWorkflow** | [**WorkflowWorkflowInfoRelationship**](WorkflowWorkflowInfoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Server** | [**ComputePhysicalRelationship**](ComputePhysicalRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
