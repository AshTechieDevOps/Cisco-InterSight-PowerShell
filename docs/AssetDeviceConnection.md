# AssetDeviceConnection
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ApiVersion** | **Int64** | The version of the connector API, describes the capability of the connector&#39;s framework. If the version is lower than the current minimum supported version defined in the service managing the connection, the device connector will be connected with limited capabilities until the device connector is upgraded to a fully supported version. For example if a device connector that was released without delta inventory capabilities registers and connects to Intersight, inventory collection may be disabled until it has been upgraded. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AppPartitionNumber** | **Int64** | The partition number corresponding to the instance of the Proxy App which is managing the web-socket to the device connector. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ConnectionId** | **String** | The unique identifier for the current connection. The identifier persists across network connectivity loss and is reset on device connector process restart or platform administrator toggle of the Intersight connectivity. The connectionId can be used by services that need to interact with stateful plugins running in the device connector process. For example if a service schedules an inventory in a devices job scheduler plugin at registration it is not necessary to reschedule the job if the device loses network connectivity due to an Intersight service upgrade or intermittent network issues in the devices datacenter. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ConnectionReason** | **String** | If &#39;connectionStatus&#39; is not equal to Connected, connectionReason provides further details about why the device is not connected with Intersight. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ConnectionStatus** | **String** | The status of the persistent connection between the device connector and Intersight. * &#x60;&#x60; - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target. * &#x60;Connected&#x60; - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities. * &#x60;NotConnected&#x60; - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target. * &#x60;ClaimInProgress&#x60; - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established. * &#x60;Unclaimed&#x60; - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Custom Target details in Intersight. * &#x60;Claimed&#x60; - Custom Target is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target credentials are incorrect. | [optional] [readonly] [default to ""]
**ConnectionStatusLastChangeTime** | **System.DateTime** | The last time at which the &#39;connectionStatus&#39; property value changed. If connectionStatus is Connected, this time can be interpreted as the starting time since which a persistent connection has been maintained between Intersight and Device Connector. If connectionStatus is NotConnected, this time can be interpreted as the last time the device connector was connected with Intersight. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ConnectorVersion** | **String** | The version of the device connector running on the managed device. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DeviceExternalIpAddress** | **String** | The IP Address of the managed device as seen from Intersight at the time of registration. This could be the IP address of the managed device&#39;s interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP addresss when the managed device is deployed in a private network. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ProxyApp** | **String** | The name of the app which will proxy the messages to the device connector. | [optional] [readonly]
