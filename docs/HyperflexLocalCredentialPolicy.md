# HyperflexLocalCredentialPolicy
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "hyperflex.LocalCredentialPolicy"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "hyperflex.LocalCredentialPolicy"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Description** | **String** | Description of the policy. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | Name of the concrete policy. | [optional] 
**FactoryHypervisorPassword** | **Boolean** | Indicates if Hypervisor password is the factory set default password. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, enable this if the default password was not changed on the Hypervisor. It is required to supply a new custom Hypervisor password that will be applied to the Hypervisor during deployment. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting has no effect and the default password will be used for initial install. The Hypervisor password should be changed after deployment. | [optional] [default to $false]
**HxdpRootPwd** | **String** | HyperFlex storage controller VM password must contain a minimum of 10 characters, with at least 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 numeric, and 1 of these -_@#$%^&amp;*! special characters. | [optional] 
**HypervisorAdmin** | **String** | Hypervisor administrator username must contain only alphanumeric characters. | [optional] 
**HypervisorAdminPwd** | **String** | The ESXi root password. For HyperFlex Data Platform 3.0 or later, if the factory default password was not manually changed, you must set a new custom password. If the password was manually changed, you must not enable the factory default password property and provide the current hypervisor password. Note - All HyperFlex nodes require the same hypervisor password for installation. For HyperFlex Data Platform prior to 3.0, use the default password &quot;&quot;Cisco123&quot;&quot; for newly manufactured HyperFlex servers. A custom password should only be entered if hypervisor credentials were manually changed prior to deployment. | [optional] 
**IsHxdpRootPwdSet** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the value of the &#39;hxdpRootPwd&#39; property has been set. | [optional] [readonly] [default to $false]
**IsHypervisorAdminPwdSet** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the value of the &#39;hypervisorAdminPwd&#39; property has been set. | [optional] [readonly] [default to $false]
**ClusterProfiles** | [**HyperflexClusterProfileRelationship[]**](HyperflexClusterProfileRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. | [optional] 
**Organization** | [**OrganizationOrganizationRelationship**](OrganizationOrganizationRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
