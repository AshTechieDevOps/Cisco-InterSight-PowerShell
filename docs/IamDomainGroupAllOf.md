## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "iam.DomainGroup"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "iam.DomainGroup"]
**Name** | **String** | The name of the domain-group. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Partition1** | **Int64** | The partition number domain group related messages are produced for &#39;Partition1&#39; category service topics. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Partition2** | **Int64** | In a cloud environment this parameter will indicate to which partition number domain group related messages are produced for &#39;Partition2&#39; category service topics. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Partition3** | **Int64** | In a cloud environment this parameter will indicate to which partition number domain group related messages are produced for &#39;Partition3&#39; category service topics. | [optional] [readonly] 
**PartitionKey** | **String** | Partition key used for producing messages to Kafka partitions. By default Domain-group id will be used as parition key. For Domain-groups belonging to Early adopters domain-group id will be prefixed with &#39;H&#39; and used as partition key, such partition key will be treated differently and messages will always be produced to partition 0. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Usage** | **Int64** | The number of devices in the domain-group. Device registration notifications are processed to update the usage of the domain-group. The on-boarding account will have multiple domain-groups, and during the device registration least used domain-group will be selected for the device. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Account** | [**IamAccountRelationship**](IamAccountRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
