# StoragePureProtectionGroupSnapshotRelationship
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "storage.PureProtectionGroupSnapshot"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "storage.PureProtectionGroupSnapshot"]
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Selector** | **String** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Link** | **String** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreatedTime** | **System.DateTime** | Protection group snapshot creation time. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Name** | **String** | Protection group snapshot name which represents point-in-time copy of all members in protection group. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Size** | **Int64** | Snapshot size represented in bytes. It is a cumulative size of all snapshots in a set. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Source** | **String** | Source protection group name on which the snapshot is created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Array** | [**StoragePureArrayRelationship**](StoragePureArrayRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**ProtectionGroup** | [**StoragePureProtectionGroupRelationship**](StoragePureProtectionGroupRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**RegisteredDevice** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
