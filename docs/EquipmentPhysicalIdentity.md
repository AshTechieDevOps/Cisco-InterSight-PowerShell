# EquipmentPhysicalIdentity
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AdminAction** | **String** | Updated by UI/API to trigger specific chassis action type. * &#x60;None&#x60; - No operation value for maintenance actions on an equipment. * &#x60;Decommission&#x60; - Decommission the equipment and temporarily remove it from being managed by Intersight. * &#x60;Recommission&#x60; - Recommission the equipment. * &#x60;Reack&#x60; - Reacknowledge the equipment and discover it again. * &#x60;Remove&#x60; - Remove the equipment permanently from Intersight management. | [optional] [default to "None"]
**AdminActionState** | **String** | The state of Maintenance Action performed. This will have three states. Applying - Action is in progress. Applied - Action is completed and applied. Failed - Action has failed. * &#x60;None&#x60; - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user. * &#x60;Applied&#x60; - User configured settings are in applied state. * &#x60;Applying&#x60; - User settings are being applied on the target server. * &#x60;Failed&#x60; - User configured settings could not be applied. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "None"]
**Identifier** | **Int64** | Numeric Identifier assigned by the management system to the equipment. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Lifecycle** | **String** | The equipment&#39;s lifecycle status. * &#x60;None&#x60; - Default state of an equipment. This should be an initial state when no state is defined for an equipment. * &#x60;Active&#x60; - Default Lifecycle State for a physical entity. * &#x60;Decommissioned&#x60; - Decommission Lifecycle state. * &#x60;DecommissionInProgress&#x60; - Decommission Inprogress Lifecycle state. * &#x60;RecommissionInProgress&#x60; - Recommission Inprogress Lifecycle state. * &#x60;OperationFailed&#x60; - Failed Operation Lifecycle state. * &#x60;ReackInProgress&#x60; - ReackInProgress Lifecycle state. * &#x60;RemoveInProgress&#x60; - RemoveInProgress Lifecycle state. * &#x60;Discovered&#x60; - Discovered Lifecycle state. * &#x60;DiscoveryInProgress&#x60; - DiscoveryInProgress Lifecycle state. * &#x60;DiscoveryFailed&#x60; - DiscoveryFailed Lifecycle state. * &#x60;FirmwareUpgradeInProgress&#x60; - Firmware upgrade is in progress on given physical entity. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "None"]
**Model** | **String** | The vendor provided model name for the equipment. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Serial** | **String** | The serial number of the equipment. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Vendor** | **String** | The manufacturer of the equipment. | [optional] [readonly] 
**RegisteredDevice** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PhysicalDeviceRegistration** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
