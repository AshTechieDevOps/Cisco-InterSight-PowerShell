# ChassisConfigChangeDetail
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "chassis.ConfigChangeDetail"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "chassis.ConfigChangeDetail"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Changes** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**ConfigChangeContext** | [**PolicyConfigResultContext**](PolicyConfigResultContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**ConfigChangeFlag** | **String** | Config change flag to differentiate Pending-changes and Config-drift. * &#x60;Pending-changes&#x60; - Config change flag represents changes are due to not deployed changes from Intersight. * &#x60;Drift-changes&#x60; - Config change flag represents changes are due to endpoint configuration changes. | [optional] [default to "Pending-changes"]
**Disruptions** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**Message** | **String** | Detailed description of the config change. | [optional] 
**ModStatus** | **String** | Modification status of the mo in this config change. * &#x60;None&#x60; - The &#39;none&#39; operation/state.Indicates a configuration profile has been deployed, and the desired configuration matches the actual device configuration. * &#x60;Created&#x60; - The &#39;create&#39; operation/state.Indicates a configuration profile has been created and associated with a device, but the configuration specified in the profilehas not been applied yet. For example, this could happen when the user creates a server profile and has not deployed the profile yet. * &#x60;Modified&#x60; - The &#39;update&#39; operation/state.Indicates some of the desired configuration changes specified in a profile have not been been applied to the associated device.This happens when the user has made changes to a profile and has not deployed the changes yet, or when the workflow to applythe configuration changes has not completed succesfully. * &#x60;Deleted&#x60; - The &#39;delete&#39; operation/state.Indicates a configuration profile has been been disassociated from a device and the user has not undeployed these changes yet. | [optional] [default to "None"]
**VarProfile** | [**ChassisProfileRelationship**](ChassisProfileRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
