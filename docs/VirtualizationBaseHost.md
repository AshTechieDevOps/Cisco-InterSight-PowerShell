# VirtualizationBaseHost
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**RegisteredDevice** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**CpuInfo** | [**VirtualizationCpuInfo**](VirtualizationCpuInfo.md) |  | [optional] 
**HardwareInfo** | [**InfraHardwareInfo**](InfraHardwareInfo.md) |  | [optional] 
**HypervisorType** | **String** | Identifies the broad type of the underlying hypervisor. * &#x60;ESXi&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is a Vmware ESXi hypervisor of any version. * &#x60;HyperFlexAp&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Cisco HyperFlex Application Platform. * &#x60;Hyper-V&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Microsoft Hyper-V. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is not known. | [optional] [default to "ESXi"]
**Identity** | **String** | The internally generated identity of this host. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the datacenter object. For VMware, this is an MOR (managed object reference). | [optional] 
**MaintenanceMode** | **Boolean** | Is this host in maintenance mode. Set to true or false. | [optional] 
**MemoryCapacity** | [**VirtualizationMemoryCapacity**](VirtualizationMemoryCapacity.md) |  | [optional] 
**Model** | **String** | Commercial model information about this hardware. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | Name of this host supplied by user. It is not the identity of the host. The name is subject to user manipulations. | [optional] 
**ProcessorCapacity** | [**VirtualizationComputeCapacity**](VirtualizationComputeCapacity.md) |  | [optional] 
**ProductInfo** | [**VirtualizationProductInfo**](VirtualizationProductInfo.md) |  | [optional] 
**Serial** | **String** | Serial number of this host (internally generated). | [optional] 
**Status** | **String** | Host health status, as reported by the hypervisor platform. * &#x60;Unknown&#x60; - Entity status is unknown. * &#x60;Degraded&#x60; - State is degraded, and might impact normal operation of the entity. * &#x60;Critical&#x60; - Entity is in a critical state, impacting operations. * &#x60;Ok&#x60; - Entity status is in a stable state, operating normally. | [optional] [default to "Unknown"]
**UpTime** | **String** | The uptime of the host, stored as Duration (from w3c). | [optional] 
**Uuid** | **String** | Universally unique identity of this host (example b3d4483b-5560-9342-8309-b486c9236610). Internally generated. | [optional] 
**Vendor** | **String** | Commercial vendor details of this hardware. | [optional]
