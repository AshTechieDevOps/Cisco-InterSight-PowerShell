# CondHclStatusDetailRelationship
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "cond.HclStatusDetail"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "cond.HclStatusDetail"]
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Selector** | **String** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Link** | **String** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**HardwareStatus** | **String** | The model is considered as part of the hardware profile for the component. This will provide the HCL validation status for the hardware profile. The reasons can be one of the following &quot;&quot;Incompatible-Server-With-Component&quot;&quot; - the server model and component combination is not listed in HCL &quot;&quot;Incompatible-Firmware&quot;&quot; - The server&#39;s firmware is not listed for this component&#39;s hardware profile &quot;&quot;Incompatible-Component&quot;&quot; - the component&#39;s model is not listed in the HCL &quot;&quot;Service-Unavailable&quot;&quot; - HCL data service is unavailable at the moment (try again later). This could be due to HCL data updating &quot;&quot;Not-Evaluated&quot;&quot; - the hardware profile was not evaulated for the component because the server&#39;s hw/sw status is not listed or server is exempted. &quot;&quot;Compatible&quot;&quot; - this component&#39;s hardware profile is listed in the HCL. * &#x60;Missing-Os-Driver-Info&#x60; - The validation failed becaue the given server has no OS driver information available in the inventory. Either install ucstools vib or use power shell scripts to tag proper OS information. * &#x60;Incompatible-Server-With-Component&#x60; - The validation failed for this component because he server model and component model combination was not found in the HCL. * &#x60;Incompatible-Processor&#x60; - The validation failed because the given processor was not found for the given server PID. * &#x60;Incompatible-Os-Info&#x60; - The validation failed because the given OS vendor and version was not found in HCL for the server PID and processor combination. * &#x60;Incompatible-Component-Model&#x60; - The validation failed because the given Component model was not found in the HCL for the given server PID, processor, server Firmware and OS vendor and version. * &#x60;Incompatible-Firmware&#x60; - The validation failed because the given server firmware or adapter firmware was not found in the HCL for the given server PID, processor, OS vendor and version and component model. * &#x60;Incompatible-Driver&#x60; - The validation failed because the given driver version was not found in the HCL for the given Server PID, processor, OS vendor and version, server firmware and component firmware. * &#x60;Incompatible-Firmware-Driver&#x60; - The validation failed because the given component firmware and driver version was not found in the HCL for the given Server PID, processor, OS vendor and version and server firmware. * &#x60;Service-Unavailable&#x60; - The validation has failed because HCL data service is temporarily not available. The server will be re-evaluated once HCL data service is back online or finished importing new HCL data. * &#x60;Service-Error&#x60; - The validation has failed because the HCL data service has return a service error or unrecognized result. * &#x60;Unrecognized-Protocol&#x60; - The validation has failed for the HCL component because the HCL data service has return a validation reason that is unknown to this service. This reason is used as a default failure reason reason in case we cannot map the error reason received from the HCL data service unto one of the other enum values. * &#x60;Not-Evaluated&#x60; - The validation for the hardware or software HCL status was not yet evaluated because some previous validation had failed. For example if a server&#39;s hardware profile fails to validate with HCL, then the server&#39;s software status will not be evaluated. * &#x60;Compatible&#x60; - The validation has passed for this server PID, processor, OS vendor and version, component model, component firmware and driver version. | [optional] [default to "Missing-Os-Driver-Info"]
