## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "tam.PsirtSeverity"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "tam.PsirtSeverity"]
**Level** | **String** | Severity level associated with the security advisory. * &#x60;critical&#x60; - &lt; If applicable, it may expose users to critical failures and it needs to be addressed immediately. For e.g. a PSIRT advisory with a corresponding CVSS score of above 9.0. * &#x60;high&#x60; - &lt; If applicable, it may expose the users to critical failure and it needs to be addressed immediately. For e.g. a PSIRT advisory with a corresponding CVSS score between 7.0-8.9. These may be the vulnerabilities that are more difficult to exploit than the ones deemed critical but once exploited, the will cause critical failures. * &#x60;medium&#x60; - &lt; If applicable, it may expose the users to failure of certain functions. for e.g. a PSIRT advisory with a corresponding CVSS score between 4.0-6.9. These may be the vulnerabilities that are mitigated to a large extent but that may still be exploited in certain restricted cases. * &#x60;info&#x60; - &lt; If applicable, it may have some minimal impact for certain functions in the user environment. For e.g. a PSIRT advisory with a corresponding CVSS score below 4.0. | [optional] [default to "critical"]
