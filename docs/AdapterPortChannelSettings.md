# AdapterPortChannelSettings
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**Enabled** | **Boolean** | When Port Channel is enabled, two vNICs and two vHBAs are available for use on the adapter card. When disabled, four vNICs and four vHBAs are available for use on the adapter card. Disabling port channel reboots the server. Port Channel is supported only for Cisco VIC 1455/1457 adapters. | [optional]
