# FirmwareUpgradeImpact
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "firmware.UpgradeImpact"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "firmware.UpgradeImpact"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Components** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**ComputationState** | **String** | Captures the status of an upgrade impact calculation. Indicates whether the calculation is complete, in progress or the calculation is impossible due to the absence of the target image on the endpoint. * &#x60;Inprogress&#x60; - Upgrade impact calculation is in progress. * &#x60;Completed&#x60; - Upgrade impact calculation is completed. * &#x60;Unavailable&#x60; - Upgrade impact is not available since image is not present in FI. | [optional] [default to "Inprogress"]
**ExcludeComponents** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**Impacts** | [**FirmwareBaseImpact[]**](FirmwareBaseImpact.md) |  | [optional] 
**Summary** | **String** | The summary on the component or components getting impacted by the upgrade. * &#x60;Basic&#x60; - Summary of a single instance involved in the upgrade operation. * &#x60;Detail&#x60; - Summary of the collection of single instances for a complex component involved in the upgrade operation. For example, in case of a server upgrade, a detailed summary indicates impact of all the single instances which are part of the server, such as storage controller, drives, and BIOS. | [optional] [default to "Basic"]
**Chassis** | [**EquipmentChassisRelationship[]**](EquipmentChassisRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to equipmentChassis resources. | [optional] 
**Device** | [**AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship[]**](AssetDeviceRegistrationRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to assetDeviceRegistration resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Distributable** | [**FirmwareDistributableRelationship**](FirmwareDistributableRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**NetworkElements** | [**NetworkElementRelationship[]**](NetworkElementRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to networkElement resources. | [optional] 
**Release** | [**SoftwarerepositoryReleaseRelationship**](SoftwarerepositoryReleaseRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Server** | [**ComputePhysicalRelationship[]**](ComputePhysicalRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to computePhysical resources. | [optional]
