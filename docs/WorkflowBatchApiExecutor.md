# WorkflowBatchApiExecutor
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "workflow.BatchApiExecutor"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "workflow.BatchApiExecutor"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Batch** | [**WorkflowApi[]**](WorkflowApi.md) |  | [optional] 
**Constraints** | [**WorkflowTaskConstraints**](WorkflowTaskConstraints.md) |  | [optional] 
**Description** | **String** | A detailed description about the batch APIs. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | Name for the batch API task. | [optional] 
**Outcomes** | [**AnyType**](.md) | All the possible outcomes of this task are captured here. Outcomes property is a collection property of type workflow.Outcome objects. The outcomes can be mapped to the message to be shown. The outcomes are evaluated in the order they are given. At the end of the outcomes list, an catchall success/fail outcome can be added with condition as &#39;true&#39;. This is an optional property and if not specified the task will be marked as success. | [optional] 
**Output** | [**AnyType**](.md) | Intersight Orchestrator allows the extraction of required values from API responses using the API response grammar. These extracted values can be mapped to task output parameters defined in task definition. The mapping of API output parameters to the task output parameters is provided as JSON in this property. | [optional] 
**RetryFromFailedApi** | **Boolean** | When an execution of a nth API in the Batch fails, Retry from falied API flag indicates if the execution should start from the nth API or the first API during task retry. By default the value is set to false. | [optional] 
**SkipOnCondition** | **String** | The skip expression, if provided, allows the batch API executor to skip the task execution when the given expression evaluates to true. The expression is given as such a golang template that has to be evaluated to a final content true/false. The expression is an optional and in case not provided, the API will always be executed. | [optional] 
**ErrorResponseHandler** | [**WorkflowErrorResponseHandlerRelationship**](WorkflowErrorResponseHandlerRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**TaskDefinition** | [**WorkflowTaskDefinitionRelationship**](WorkflowTaskDefinitionRelationship.md) |  | [optional]
