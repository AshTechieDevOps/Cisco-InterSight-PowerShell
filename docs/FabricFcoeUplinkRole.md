# FabricFcoeUplinkRole
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "fabric.FcoeUplinkRole"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "fabric.FcoeUplinkRole"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Var0ClusterReplicationNetworkPolicy** | [**HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship**](HyperflexClusterReplicationNetworkPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**AggregatePortId** | **Int64** | Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface. When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused. When a port is configured as a breakout port, the &#39;aggregatePortId&#39; port number as labeled on the equipment, e.g. the id of the port on the switch. | [optional] 
**PortId** | **Int64** | Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface. When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the portId is the port number as labeled on the equipment, e.g. the id of the port on the switch, FEX or chassis. When a port is configured as a breakout port, the &#39;portId&#39; represents the port id on the fanout side of the breakout cable. | [optional] 
**SlotId** | **Int64** | Slot Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface. | [optional] 
**PortPolicy** | [**FabricPortPolicyRelationship**](FabricPortPolicyRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**AdminSpeed** | **String** | Admin configured speed for the port. * &#x60;Auto&#x60; - Admin configurable speed AUTO ( default ). * &#x60;1Gbps&#x60; - Admin configurable speed 1Gbps. * &#x60;10Gbps&#x60; - Admin configurable speed 10Gbps. * &#x60;25Gbps&#x60; - Admin configurable speed 25Gbps. * &#x60;40Gbps&#x60; - Admin configurable speed 40Gbps. * &#x60;100Gbps&#x60; - Admin configurable speed 100Gbps. | [optional] [default to "Auto"]
**Fec** | **String** | Forward error correction configuration for the port. * &#x60;Auto&#x60; - Forward error correction option &#39;Auto&#39;. * &#x60;Cl91&#x60; - Forward error correction option &#39;cl91&#39;. * &#x60;Cl74&#x60; - Forward error correction option &#39;cl74&#39;. | [optional] [default to "Auto"]
**UdldAdminState** | **String** | Admin configured state for UDLD for this port. * &#x60;Disabled&#x60; - Admin configured Disabled State. * &#x60;Enabled&#x60; - Admin configured Enabled State. | [optional] [default to "Disabled"]
