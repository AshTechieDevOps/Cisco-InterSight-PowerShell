# LicenseLicenseInfo
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "license.LicenseInfo"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "license.LicenseInfo"]
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly]

**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ActiveAdmin** | **Boolean** | The license administrative state. Set this property to &#39;true&#39; to activate the license entitlements. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DaysLeft** | **Int64** | The number of days left for licenseState to stay in TrialPeriod or OutOfCompliance state. | [optional] [readonly] 
**EndTime** | **System.DateTime** | The date and time when the trial period expires. The value of the &#39;endTime&#39; property is set when the account enters the TrialPeriod or OutOfCompliance state. | [optional] [readonly] 
**EnforceMode** | **String** | The entitlement mode reported by Cisco Smart Software Manager. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ErrorDesc** | **String** | The detailed error message when there is any error related to this licensing entitlement. | [optional] [readonly] 
**EvaluationPeriod** | **Int64** | The default Trial or Grace period customer is entitled to. | [optional]

**LicenseCount** | **Int64** | The total number of devices claimed in the Intersight account. | [optional] [readonly]

**LicenseType** | **String** | The name of the Intersight license entitlement. For example, this property may be set to &#39;Essential&#39;. * &#x60;Base&#x60; - Base as a License type. It is default license type. * &#x60;Essential&#x60; - Essential as a License type. * &#x60;Standard&#x60; - Standard as a License type. * &#x60;Advantage&#x60; - Advantage as a License type. * &#x60;Premier&#x60; - Premier as a License type. * &#x60;IWO-Essential&#x60; - IWO-Essential as a License type. * &#x60;IWO-Advantage&#x60; - IWO-Advantage as a License type. * &#x60;IWO-Premier&#x60; - IWO-Premier as a License type. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "Base"]

**TrialAdmin** | **Boolean** | The administrative state of the trial license. When the LicenseState is set to &#39;NotLicensed&#39;, &#39;trialAdmin&#39; can be set to true to start the trial period, i.e. licenseState is set to be TrialPeriod. | [optional] [readonly]
