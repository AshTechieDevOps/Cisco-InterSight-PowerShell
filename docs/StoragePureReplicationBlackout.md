# StoragePureReplicationBlackout
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. Its value must be the same as the &#39;objectType&#39; property. The OpenAPI document references this property as a discriminator value. | [readonly] 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The concrete type of this complex type. The ObjectType property must be set explicitly by API clients when the type is ambiguous. In all other cases, the  ObjectType is optional.  The type is ambiguous when a managed object contains an array of nested documents, and the documents in the array are heterogeneous, i.e. the array can contain nested documents of different types. | 
**VarEnd** | **String** | The end time of day for replication blackout window. Example: 17:00:01 which is 17 hours, 0 minutes, 1 seconds. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Start** | **String** | The start time of day when replication blackout is active. When replication blackout is active, the storage array temporarily disables replication. Example: 15:04:03.123 which is 15 hours, 4 minutes, 3 seconds and 123 milliseconds. The fractional seconds are written using the standard decimal notation which can be used for setting milliseconds and microseconds. | [optional] [readonly]
