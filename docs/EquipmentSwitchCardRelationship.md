# EquipmentSwitchCardRelationship
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. | [default to "equipment.SwitchCard"]
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. | [default to "equipment.SwitchCard"]
**Moid** | **String** | The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. | [optional] 
**Selector** | **String** | An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field may be set instead of &#39;moid&#39; by clients. 1. If &#39;moid&#39; is set this field is ignored. 1. If &#39;selector&#39; is set and &#39;moid&#39; is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of the resource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the object instance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request. An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource. An example filter string is: Serial eq &#39;3AA8B7T11&#39;. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Link** | **String** | A URL to an instance of the &#39;mo.MoRef&#39; class. | [optional] 
**AccountMoid** | **String** | The Account ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**CreateTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was created. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DomainGroupMoid** | **String** | The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**ModTime** | **System.DateTime** | The time when this managed object was last modified. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Owners** | **String[]** |  | [optional] 
**SharedScope** | **String** | Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs. Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a &#39;shared&#39; ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Tags** | [**MoTag[]**](MoTag.md) |  | [optional] 
**VersionContext** | [**MoVersionContext**](MoVersionContext.md) |  | [optional] 
**Ancestors** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Parent** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PermissionResources** | [**MoBaseMoRelationship[]**](MoBaseMoRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to moBaseMo resources. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DisplayNames** | [**System.Collections.Hashtable**](Array.md) | A set of display names for the MO resource. These names are calculated based on other properties of the MO and potentially properties of Ancestor MOs. Displaynames are intended as a way to provide a normalized user appropriate name for an MO, especially for MOs which do not have a &#39;Name&#39; property, which is the case for much of the inventory discovered from managed targets. There are a limited number of keys, currently &#39;short&#39; and &#39;hierarchical&#39;. The value is an array and clients should use the first element of the array. | [optional] [readonly] 
**DeviceMoId** | **String** | The database identifier of the registered device of an object. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Dn** | **String** | The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Rn** | **String** | The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Model** | **String** | This field identifies the model of the given component. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Revision** | **String** | This field identifies the revision of the given component. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Serial** | **String** | This field identifies the serial of the given component. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Vendor** | **String** | This field identifies the vendor of the given component. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Description** | **String** | Detailed description of this switch hardware. | [optional] [readonly] 
**EthernetSwitchingMode** | **String** | The user configured Ethernet switching mode for this switch (End-Host or Switch). * &#x60;end-host&#x60; - In end-host mode, the fabric interconnects appear to the upstream devices as end hosts with multiple links.In this mode, the switch does not run Spanning Tree Protocol and avoids loops by following a set of rules for traffic forwarding.In case of ethernet switching mode - Ethernet end-host mode is also known as Ethernet host virtualizer. * &#x60;switch&#x60; - In switch mode, the switch runs Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid loops, and broadcast and multicast packets are handled in the traditional way.This is the traditional switch mode. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "end-host"]
**FcSwitchingMode** | **String** | The user configured FC switching mode for this switch (End-Host or Switch). * &#x60;end-host&#x60; - In end-host mode, the fabric interconnects appear to the upstream devices as end hosts with multiple links.In this mode, the switch does not run Spanning Tree Protocol and avoids loops by following a set of rules for traffic forwarding.In case of ethernet switching mode - Ethernet end-host mode is also known as Ethernet host virtualizer. * &#x60;switch&#x60; - In switch mode, the switch runs Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid loops, and broadcast and multicast packets are handled in the traditional way.This is the traditional switch mode. | [optional] [readonly] [default to "end-host"]
**NumPorts** | **Int64** | Number of ports present in this switch hardware. | [optional] [readonly] 
**OutOfBandIpAddress** | **String** | Field specifies this Switch&#39;s Out-of-band IP address. | [optional] [readonly] 
**OutOfBandIpGateway** | **String** | Field specifies this Switch&#39;s default gateway for the out-of-band management interface. | [optional] [readonly] 
**Presence** | **String** | Presence for this switch hardware. | [optional] [readonly] 
**SlotId** | **Int64** | Slot identifier of the local Switch slot Interface. | [optional] [readonly] 
**State** | **String** | Operational state of the switch hardware. | [optional] [readonly] 
**SwitchId** | **String** | Switch Identifier that is local to a cluster. | [optional] [readonly] 
**FcPortChannels** | [**FcPortChannelRelationship[]**](FcPortChannelRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to fcPortChannel resources. | [optional] 
**InventoryDeviceInfo** | [**InventoryDeviceInfoRelationship**](InventoryDeviceInfoRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**NetworkElement** | [**NetworkElementRelationship**](NetworkElementRelationship.md) |  | [optional] 
**PortChannels** | [**EtherPortChannelRelationship[]**](EtherPortChannelRelationship.md) | An array of relationships to etherPortChannel resources. | [optional]
