# WorkflowAbstractWorkerTask
## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ClassId** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payload when marshaling and unmarshaling data. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**ObjectType** | **String** | The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type. The value should be the same as the &#39;ClassId&#39; property. The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. | 
**Description** | **String** | The description of this task instance in the workflow. | [optional] 
**Label** | **String** | A user defined label identifier of the workflow task used for UI display. | [optional] 
**Name** | **String** | The name of the task within the workflow and it must be unique among all WorkflowTasks within a workflow definition. This name serves as the internal unique identifier for the task and is used to pick input and output parameters to feed into other tasks. | [optional] 
**InputParameters** | [**AnyType**](.md) | JSON formatted map that defines the input given to the task. JSONPath is used for chaining output from previous tasks as inputs into the current task. The format to specify the mapping is &#39;${Source.input/output.JsonPath}&#39;. &#39;Source&#39; can be either workflow or the name of the task within the workflow. You can map the task input to either a workflow input or a task output. Following this is JSON path expression to extract JSON fragment from source&#39;s input/output. | [optional] 
**OnFailure** | **String** | This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task fails.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node. | [optional] 
**OnSuccess** | **String** | This specifies the name of the next task to run if Task succeeds.  This is the unique name given to the task instance within the workflow. In a graph model, denotes an edge to another Task Node. | [optional] 
**RollbackDisabled** | **Boolean** | The task is disabled/enabled for rollback operation in this workflow if the task has rollback support. | [optional] [default to $false]
**UseDefault** | **Boolean** | UseDefault when set to true, means the default version of the task or workflow will be used at the time of execution. When this property is set then version for task or subworkflow cannot be set. When workflow is created or updated the default version of task or subworkflow will be used for validation, but when the workflow is executed the default version that that time will be used for validation and subsequent execution. | [optional] [default to $false]

## Examples

- Prepare the resource
```powershell
$WorkflowAbstractWorkerTask = Initialize-IntersightWorkflowAbstractWorkerTask  -ClassId null `
 -ObjectType null `

 -Label null `
 -Name null `
 -InputParameters null `
 -OnFailure null `
 -OnSuccess null `
 -RollbackDisabled null `
 -UseDefault null
```

- Convert the resource to JSON
```powershell
$WorkflowAbstractWorkerTask | ConvertTo-JSON
```
